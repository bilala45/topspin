# TopSpin (CIS 550 Final Project)

### Description

TopSpin is a web application that aims to use compelling data across ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (Womenâ€™s Tennis Association) tournaments and matches to provide greater insight into the most infamous question in any sport - who is the greatest of all time (GOAT)? It aggregates data about athletes, rankings, and matches dating back to late 1800s, and match odds from 2000 to 2019. The web app displays various dynamic summary views and more in-depth pages about tennis players and matches based on historical data.

### Data

#### Raw Data

The core data used for this project consists of information about tennis tournaments, matches, and players through time dating back to the late 1800s for ATP and early 1900s for WTA. It is available on github in Jeff Sackmann's repos:

- [tennis_wta](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_wta)
- [tennis_atp](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp)

Additionally, we use betting odds for tennis matches after 2000, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hakeem/atp-and-wta-tennis-data) and on [github](https://github.com/chief-r0cka/MLT).

#### Preprocessed Data

Due to constraints on file size, cleaned and aggregated data is stored in CSV files in a shared drive (request access [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14wodIUZZj7R28aX-mTczlzbZ5z_Nh_bw?usp=sharing)).
